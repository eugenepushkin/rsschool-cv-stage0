## About me: 


	Hi. My name is Yauheni. I am 22 years old and I work as a design engineer. I studied at the Faculty of Information 
	Technology and Robotics at the Belarusian National Technical University. I have just started to study Ftont-End so I ask you 
	not to judge strictly. Peace for everyone.

## Skills:


	Today I know HTML, CSS and JS at a basic level. Recently completed preparatory online courses. I strive to develop in this 
	direction and want to become a real professional!

## Code example:

	KATA from CODEWARS: An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a 
	function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. 
	Ignore letter case.

	function isIsogram(str){
		let arrStr = str.split('');
		for (let i = 0; i < arrStr.length; i++) {
			for (let j = (i+1); j < arrStr.length; j++) {
				if (arrStr[i].toLowerCase() == arrStr[j].toLowerCase()) {
					return false
				}
			}
		}	return true
	}
